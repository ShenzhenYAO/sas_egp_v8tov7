<!-- an EGTreeNode in ProjectCollection.External_Objects.ProjectTreeView (the EGTreeNode is for a process flow) -->
<!-- Note !!! such EGTreeNode is unique for v7, no such tag in v8.-->
<!-- When converting from v8 to v7:
    1. In ProjectCollection.Elements find elements
        ProjectCollection.Elements.Element and push each into an array (nontask array) if the type is 
        	SAS.EG.ProjectElements.PFD

    2. keep three fields for each element in the array
        { 
            ID: the element id from ProjectCollection.Elements.Element.Element.ID,
            Label: the element label from ProjectCollection.Elements.Element.Element.Label,
            Type: the attribute type of the ProjectCollection.Elements.Element.Element
        }

    The array is like: 
       [{ 
            ID: PFD-GirXDnE4Mj4CHrI5,
            Label: pfd1,
            Type: SAS.EG.ProjectElements.PFD

        },
        { 
            ID: PFD-6nSfH71ogEk2upEN,
            Label: pfd2,
            Type: SAS.EG.ProjectElements.PFD

        }]

    3. Make a list of ProjectCollection.External_Objects.ProjectTreeView.EGTreeNode.EGTreeNode for the v7 file,
        each from an element in the array.
        for each of the ProjectCollection.External_Objects.ProjectTreeView.EGTreeNode.EGTreeNode,
        set the following tag:
        1) <NodeType>NODETYPE_ELEMENT</NodeType> (fixed value)
        2) set the innerText of the tag ElementID as the ID property from the element of the new array
        (e.g., <ElementID>ShortCutToFile-frOMCUhUHcJWJKeO</ElementID>)
        3) set the innerText of the tag Label as the Label property from the elment of the new array
        (e.g., <Label>a.xlsx</Label>)
        4) Search for the element in the  
            v8 file's ProjectCollection.External_Objects.OpenProjectView.TreeItem 
            whereby the property ID matches the ID property from the element 
            of the new array. 
            For such a TreeItem Element, get the attribute IsExpanded, change from lower case
            to proper case (e.g., 'true' to 'True'), and set as innerText of the tag Expanded.
        (e.g., <Expanded>True</Expanded>) 
-->



When converting from v8 to v7, a EGTreeNode for each process flow should be created 
    and appended into ProjectCollection.External_Objects.ProjectTreeView
    Within the EGTreeNode, there should be four tags for properties:
    <NodeType>NODETYPE_ELEMENT</NodeType> (fixed value)
    <ElementID>PFD-GirXDnE4Mj4CHrI5</ElementID> 
    The PFD ID from a corresponding element for a v8 process flow
        in ProjectCollection.Elements.Element whereby
            its attribute type = "SAS.EG.ProjectElements.ProcessFlowContainer"
    For such a ProjectCollection.Elements.Element, the innderText of 
            ProjectCollection.Elements.Element.Element.ID is the PFD ID to be copied for
        the innerText of ElementID of v7.

    Note: do not try to find the PFD ID from ProjectCollection.External_Objects.OpenProjectView.TreeItem of v8. 
        Some of the v8 .TreeItem might have an ID attribute begins with "PFD-", but indeed is not a process flow.
        For example, in the sample file, there is a TreeItem of which the attribute ID = "PFD-GirXDnE4Mj4CHrI5-CodeTask".
        That TreeItem is not a PFD at all!

    <Expanded>True</Expanded> The innerText of the tag Expanded is copied from the value 
        of the attribute "IsExpanded" of the .TreeItem of v8 with the sample attribute ID
        as the PFD ID identified above for the tag ElementID in v7!

    <Label>pfd1</Label> The innerText (i.e., "pfd1") of the tag Label should be obtained from
    a v8 file's ProjectCollection.Elements.Element whereby the innerText of
    ProjectCollection.Elements.Element.Element.ID is the same as the PFD ID identified for
    ElementID of v7. In such an Element, 
    the innerText of ProjectCollection.Elements.Element.Element.Label should be copied
    as the innerText of the tag Label in v7. 
    
    So, to summarize this complicated and annoying process, when converting from v8 to v7,
    1) In ProjectCollection.Elements find the elements
        ProjectCollection.Elements.Element whereby
          its attribute type = "SAS.EG.ProjectElements.ProcessFlowContainer"  
        push ProjectCollection.Elements.Element.Element.ID and          
        ProjectCollection.Elements.Element.Element.Label into an array.
        The ID and Label (of each process flow) in the array are to be used for the tag
           ElementID and Label of v7
    2) In ProjectCollection.External_Objects.OpenProjectView.TreeItem, find the .TreeItem 
        elements of which the attribute ID = the identified Process Flow ID 
            (i.e. the IDs saved in the array in step 1)
        From the identified .TreeItems (these are Process Flows), the attribute "IsExpanded"
        is used as the innerText of the tag Expanded, after transforming the values from lower case
        to proper case (e.g. from IsExpanded="true" to <Expanded>True</Expanded>)
        O-M-G! I need some air as well, Janice!

<EGTreeNode>
    <NodeType>NODETYPE_ELEMENT</NodeType>
    <ElementID>input__PFDID</ElementID>
    <Expanded>input__Expanded</Expanded>
    <Label>input__PFDLabel</Label>

    <!-- Note !!! the following is unique in v7, no such tags in v8.
    When converting from v8 to v7, need to insert a list of EGTreeNode
    input__list_EGTreeNode_for_different_type_of_nodes (i.e., for shortcut to data or file, egtask, codetask, etc) 
    
    Here is the wired setting in v7:
    
    For a particular type of node (e.g., shortcut to file), if there is only one node, the
        node is directly listed as the second layer of EGTreeNode
        i.e., appended as ProjectCollection.External_Objects.ProjectTreeView.EGTreeNode.EGTreeNode
    Thus, a list of single nodes of different types are inserted in the following: 
    -->
    <!-- insert a list of EGTreeNode elements, each for a different type, the prototype is from __f00a_external_objects_00_projecttreeview_egtreenode_egtreenode_nontask_v7.xml -->
    input__list_EGTreeNode_single_for_each_type
    
    <!-- insert a list of EGTreeNode elements, each is of a different type and contains more than one 
        tree nodes, the prototype is from __f00b_external_objects_00_projecttreeview_egtreenode_egtreenode_programs_v7.xml -->
    input__list_EGTreeNode_multiple_for_each_type
</EGTreeNode>
